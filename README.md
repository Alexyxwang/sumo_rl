A helpful tutorial for RL in sumo:

Basic example of RL code with Q tables (not DQN) that is very interpretable:

DQN explanation:

I think we could recreate some realistic busy intersections in sydney (with lots of assumptions of course).



What we need for our project:

Figure out state space, action space, reward, when to terminate, DQN structure, hardest part is prob figuring out SUMO (the software is a bit antique but should be fine following tuts)
BTW need to download SUMO separately to this github repo
